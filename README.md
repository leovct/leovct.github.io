This is my personal blog. The website is simple, it references the articles I have written, a page about me and some links to my networks.

I use [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/) because it's a powerful open-source static site generator and I combine it with the minimalist [`nodejh/hugo-theme-mini`](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini) theme. The website is hosted on Github Pages which makes it super easy to maintain (and it's free!).
